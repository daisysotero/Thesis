abstract = {Erythrina velutina Willd (Fabaceae) is an important non-model tree with pharmaceutical potential, traditionally used in folk medicine at the northeastern Brazilian semiarid region. The species shows anti-inflammatory properties and central nervous system modulation. Our previous work highlighted its capacity of biosynthesizing several bioactive compounds. It was also possible to identify enzyme and transcription factor genes involved in the response to both biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the identification of reference genes (RGs) for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays and validation of molecular mechanisms is still lacking. Leaves and seeds of field-grown plants and shoots of seedlings exposed to defense phytohormones (sodium nitroprusside and methyl jasmonate, the former as source of nitric oxide) were examined. As a result, 60 transcripts had RPKM (log2) > 2 and CV < 10 %, from which the 11 most conserved were selected: NADH, 26S, UPF, PBL27, CYB5, ARP4, ARD2, OAT, CSTF64, NLE, and RAB7. CSTF64, RAB7, NLE, UPF and ARP4 exhibited the highest stability and showed positive, and significant correlations, while NADH and PBL27 were the least stable genes. The use of two genes was sufficient for normalizing qPCR assays, and the best gene pairs were recommended. All reference genes were validated with target genes, sequenced, and showed adequate melting curves and amplification efficiency. This pioneering identification of reference genes in Erythrina velutina provides a platform for future molecular studies in this unique dryland species. The herein described approach can also be useful in identifying adequate housekeeping genes in other non-model plant species.}
